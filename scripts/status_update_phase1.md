# Project Status Update â€“ SnapFlow Phase 1 Complete

**To:** Gemini Studio  
**Subject:** Taskmaster & Claude Execution Update

---

## âœ… Summary of Action Taken:
We completed **Phase 1** of the SnapFlow project:  
**"Project Foundation & Server Setup"** using **Claude** as the active implementer.

Although the plan originated from your Phase breakdown, this first phase was executed directly through Claude for speed and integration with Taskmaster.

---

## ðŸ”§ What Was Done:
- Express server fully initialized
- Mobile-first design foundation added via Tailwind CSS
- Static folder and view engine setup
- File upload handling and preview logic integrated
- Security middleware added: Helmet, CORS, CSP, and rate limiting
- All development and production dependencies installed
- Custom `.env` handling and health check routes included
- System ready to run with `npm start` or `npm run dev`

---

## ðŸ§  Decision Rationale:
We prioritized Claude for coding due to its direct integration with Cursor Taskmaster.  
Gemini remains part of the toolchain, especially for:
- Deep planning and architecture questions
- Alternative task breakdowns
- Ideation and re-evaluation between phases

---

## ðŸ“Œ Going Forward:
- Claude will continue executing tasks from the Taskmaster queue.
- Gemini will be consulted **between phases** or when we need to restructure, expand scope, or validate logic.
- **ChatGPT** is acting as **Project Manager** to bridge implementation and planning between Claude and Gemini, ensuring consistency and continuity.

---

We are about to begin Task #2. Youâ€™ll be updated again after its completion or if planning input is needed sooner.
