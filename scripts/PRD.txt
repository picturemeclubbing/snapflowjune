Definitive Hand-off Prompt for Gemini in Cursor
Subject: Initialize Master Plan for Project SnapFlow, Integrating the Context7 Workflow

Hello Gemini,

This prompt contains the complete context and directives for you to act as the Project Architect for a new web application called "SnapFlow." Read this entire brief carefully to understand the project, our unique workflow, and your specific role within it.

1. Our Development Workflow (Critically Important)

Our process involves a clear separation of concerns between three components:

You (Gemini via Cline Extension): The Project Architect.

Your role is to create and manage the master project plan.
You will break down the entire application into logical phases and granular, step-by-step coding tasks.
You will not write the application code. You will provide the instructions for the Coder AI.
Context7 (MCP Server by Upstash): The Documentation & Context Provider.

This server provides us with up-to-date, version-specific documentation and working code examples for all libraries in our stack.
Your plans must be structured to leverage this tool. When you define a task involving a library, know that we can feed the Coder AI with perfect context, eliminating hallucinations.
Claude (The Coder AI): The Code Implementer.

Claude's role is to write the code.
It will be given two things for each task:
The specific task instruction generated by you.
The relevant documentation for that task, supplied by Context7.
2. Project Brief: SnapFlow

Purpose: A mobile-friendly web app for event photographers to instantly upload, display, and sell photos on-site.
Technology Stack:
Node.js & Express
Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
Tailwind CSS
Sharp (for image processing)
Chokidar (for file monitoring)
Nodemailer (for email/SMS delivery)
Key Decisions Made:
Deliver web-optimized images (<2MB).
Support both static image and dynamic text watermarks (tiled by default).
Show an interstitial ad every 6 swipes.
3. Project Scaffold (Already Created)

The following empty file and folder structure has already been created for the project:

/snapflow
├── public/ (css, js, assets, ads, galleries, uploads)
├── src/ (data, modules, routes)
├── views/ (admin.html, ad_settings.html, gallery.html, index.html)
├── .env
├── app.js
├── package.json
└── tailwind.config.js
4. Your Core Mission: Generate the 7-Phase Master Plan

Your primary mission is to generate a complete, step-by-step master plan for the entire SnapFlow project. This plan will be the single source of truth that we execute from.

The plan must be broken down into seven logical phases. For each task you define that involves a specific library (e.g., setting up an Express route, processing an image with Sharp), formulate the description with the knowledge that the Coder AI will have access to the best possible documentation via Context7.

5. Required Plan Format

For each of the seven phases, you must provide the following structure:

Phase Title: A clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Phase 1: Project Foundation & Server Setup").
Objective: A one-sentence goal for the phase.
Key Files: The primary files to be created or modified.
Actionable Task List: A numbered list of granular tasks. Each task must be a clear instruction for the Coder AI.
